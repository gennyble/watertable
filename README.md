## Analysis and visualization of an observational well on North Pender Island

The well is powered by solar panels and connected over satellite, and it has a depth sensor at the base that sends measurements every hour on the hour.
It's been running since 2003.
This project superimposes every year with data on each other, with the current year highlighted.
This allows for users to clearly see how full the aquifer is, compared with earlier this year, natural levels, and all previous years.

The project is hosted by Cloudflare, and is located at [watertable.nove.dev](https://watertable.nove.dev)

To view the notebook, open the `main.ipynb` document. 
GitHub's Jupyter notebook rendering is a little flaky, so you may have to run it in your local installation.
